# Justin Piesco: Technical Writer Portfolio 

Hello!

My name is Justin Piesco, and I'm a technical writer and content manager for Microsoft under contract with Aquent.

## A Quick Overview

I'm a contributor on hundreds of Microsoft Learn articles. The "contributor" categorization applies to any writer that has published changes on a given article. Because articles can last for years or even decades, the amount of people involved can range from one to dozens of contributors. I've listed the articles in this portfolio under general categories where I was involved in creating, revising, and/or optimizing.

However, because I've worked on so many articles, in so many document sets and repositories, the articles here aren't all-inclusive. I've also worked on documentation for products including: Windows Server, Power BI, Microsoft Entra Connect, the Azure Portal, PowerShell, Power Apps, Visual Studio, and more. If you would like specific types of documentation or documentation on specific products that aren't included here, I'm happy to provide more upon request.

## Optimization

I work with SMEs to create and enhance content for customer readability, improving the overall Acrolinx score. Acrolinx is the standard updating tool that determines an articles accuracy and readability. The following are a selection of articles I've optimized:

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/application-integration/using-the-winforms-reportviewer-control
  - Improved Acrolinx score from 82% correctness to 96% correctness.
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/application-integration/integrating-reporting-services-using-soap-windows-application
  - Improved Acrolinx score from 88% correctness to 96% correctness.
-https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/application-integration/integrating-reporting-services-using-reportviewer-controls
  - Improved Acrolinx score from 75% correctness to 90% correctness.
 
NOTE: While Acrolinx is an excellent tool for content health, the human element of writing often prohibits an article from earning 100% correctness. For example, if a file name is "samplefilename.md" Acrolinx might count against the article for not having spaces between the words "sample", "file", and "name" even though "samplefilename.md" is used correctly.

## Security

Clarity, specificity, and attention to detail are integral for secure documentation. The following are articles where I verified procedural accuracy, removed Personal Identification Information (PII), and ensured functionality:

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/build-reliable-secure-programs
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/messaging-bridge
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-ad-fs-extranet-smart-lockout-protection

## Freshness
Effective writing tends to last, but eventually, technical writing inevitably goes out of date. While freshness tends to be primarily associated with SEO because of evolving relevancy and timeliness, the freshness passes I've performed have also included adjusting content for product and version updates, linguistic and/or cultural shifts, and brand-wide style guide changes. The following are examples of articles to which I applied at least one full-freshness pass.

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/report-server/report-server-executionlog-and-the-executionlog3-view
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/report-server/setting-time-out-values-for-report-and-shared-dataset-processing-ssrs
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-reporting-services-subscriptions-and-delivery

## Validation

Validating content is to the effort to eliminate potential accessibility, security, and usability issues. This includes creating effective alt-text for screen readers, ensuring metadata fits appropriate standards, verifying link functionality, and more.

## Images

Verifying procedure and providing clear, precise images is integral for customer readability. The following are articles where I performed procedure verification and created current, crisp screenshots to enhance article approachability:

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/howto-enforce-signed-saml-authentication
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/delete-application-portal
